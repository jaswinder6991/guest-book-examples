# Guest Book Example via Relayerüìñ

This repo is an example based off the basic Guest Book Example but with a relayer twist.

This repository contains example implementations of a Guest Book smart contract in both JavaScript and Rust, and an examples of a frontend interacting with a deployed Guest Book contract

## Important Notes
1. This repo uses a forked version of [wallet-selector](https://github.com/jaswinder6991/wallet-selector) which introduces signDelegateAction as a part of the wallet interface.
This is an attempt to make contributions to the wallet selector for enhanced functionality.

2. DON'T USE THIS FOR MAINNET
This repo uses a near private key in the frontend. You should use next js server to create an api end point /relay which uses near private key. Hence your private key won't be exposes in the browser.

## Pending steps
1. In the current forked wallet selector, even delegateActions with deposit gets signed with the function call. There should be a redirect to wallet page to sign delegateAction with deposit with a full access key instead.

Hence currently, if you attach a deposit, you get this error.
```
Error: {"index":0,"kind":{"index":0,"kind":{"DelegateActionAccessKeyError":"DepositWithFunctionCall‚Äù}}}
```
